# 100Devs Rapper API

### A webpage showing off information about a rapper

### Tech used: HTML, JavaScript, Node
I built out a simple HTML frontend and a server to serve all of the static files like CSS and JavaScript files. I tested the API with Postman. The API serves JSON data to the frontend and displays it on the DOM.

### Lessons Learned:
I learned how to serve static files on a node server when the browser makes an HTTP request for them.

### Optimizations
More rappers need to be added to make it more interesting! Some CSS still needs to be added

### Installation
npm install
